# Changenuity
Welcome to our team Github repo! Here you can find all of the resources for our website (folders to be uploaded soon).

# Guidelines
1. Fork a branch to work on, and merge-push when you're done. Coordinate with team members who are working on similar things through Slack (https://changenuity.slack.com/messages/general/) to avoid clashes.
2. Unless you're just updating a small thing, write descriptive commit statements!
3. **Comment your code to make it understandable by everyone.**
